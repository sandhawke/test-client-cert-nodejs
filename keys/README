For testing, we have a few well known accounts whose "private" keys
are made public here.  Well, one for now.

To create one of these key files using Firefox:
   Go to the Edit menu
   -> Preferences
   -> Advanced
   -> select Certificates tab
   -> View Certificates
   -> select Your Certificates tab
   Make the "Certificate Name" column wider if you have to
   Select the one you want to export
   Click [Backup...]
   Pick a filename, eg ~/keys/bobdemo.databox.me
   For "Certificate backup password", type x,
   For "Certificate backup password (again)", type x,
   This should enable to "ok" button; no go back and remove the x's,
   Click [OK]
   This should have created ~/keys/bobdemo.databox.me.p12

Then convert the p12 file to a pem file like:
     
   openssl pkcs12 -in bobdemo.databox.me.p12 -out bobdemo.databox.me.pem -clcerts -nodes -passin pass:
